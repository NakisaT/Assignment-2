<h3>Insidious Fine Particles</h3>
<h1>Particles as small as 2.5 micrometers, target our health</h1>

A silent death is the nature of particulate pollution. an invisible treat trampling on our most precious asset, our health, ravaging Mother Nature across Europe.
Particulate matter known as PM2.5 is to blame, for all. It refers to inhalable fine particles, as small as 2.5 micrometers, posing an immense threat to human health.
with each breath, these tiny bits penetrate into our lungs, awakening an unfavorable reaction rooting health issues spanning from cardiovascular and respiratory disease to stroke and even cancer. Some may wonder how these fine particles come into existence, well the answer is us. The source of  PM2.5 is human activities, like everyday transportation, agriculture, electricity generation, and industrial activities.

<p>
Is it still time to understand the importance of particle pollution and take urgent action? 
Here comes another reason, just in 2019, about four million lives were lost due to particle pollution exposure. We are in the battle for clean air, so every decision and action we take matters. we can be either our savior or our terminator, we can either contribute to the solutions or add more problems, it is utterly our call to make. That sounds scary right, more detailed information awaiting

Europe’s air quality status for 2023 gives rise to more concern, as the latest assessment raining an alarm reveals a worrying picture of not only our present but also our future,  pollutants levels are rising above both  EU air quality standards and WHO guidelines, where Italy and central-eastern Europe are struggling most with the highest level of particulate pollution. 

</p>


<p>
Let’s take a deeper look, based on Air quality in the EU's recent update the  PM2.5 concentration within the EU at present is 7.5 μg/m3 surpassing the  WHO’s annual limit of 5 μg/m3 by 1.5 times. if you are seeking more data <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/status-of-air-quality-in-Europe-2022/europes-air-quality-status-2022/world-health-organization-who-air">click here.</a>
Despite of notable efforts and improvements, pollution is still a persistent treat to our health and remains the leading cause of mortality across the European Union.
Air pollution is not only a threat to human health but also a threat to our environment. Its magnitude is beyond humans, razing our planet and the entire ecosystem. Now an important question arises: how can we strive against this unseen enemy? the answer is that by raising public awareness and monitoring air quality we can not only track changes but also assess our current strategies, develop new approaches, and reduce the negative impact of pollution

Let us take a moment to gaze at the world map down below, a vibrant heat map that paints a picture of PM2.5 levels across the globe from 2016 to 2024. The visualization lets us track the flow of pollution patterns and pinpoint the areas bearing the brunt of the impact and our data support these observations. However, it is crucial to remember that although the visualization is comprehensive, the amount of data varies from year to year. Due to limited data availability, there are noticeable gaps in the years before 2016, which is why yearly data displays fluctuation.
The world map clearly shows that PM2.5 pollution has had a significant impact on the world. It is not only a question of pollution, but also of how this pollution contributes to increasing world temperatures, especially in the highlighted regions.

 the Studies that show us the seasonal variations in PM2.5 levels in Europe, now confirmed by our invistigation. Look at the visualization below the result of our research. It is evident that the concentration of PM2.5 is significantly higher during the Winter and Spring seasons. The highest recorded concentration of PM2.5 in the Winter season reaches 95 µg/m³, while in the Spring season follows closely with levels, it is around 75 µg/m³.

Winter is the most polluted season, it is not just a speculation, but rather a fact confirmed by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Temperature drops, our dependence on fossil fuels rises, releasing damaging pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide(NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and our main concern PM2.5

We enmark on our journey to a city in Europe called Vinnytsia in Ukrain to do our mission. 
join os to follow our captivating findings, we are about to discover an intricate relation between PM2.5 fluctuation in regard to temperature and humidity.
An attractive detection uncoverd by this visualization bellow.In the winter as temperature drops, humidity goes up as well as PM2.5 , the nature of our narritive come to be true, winter is the most polluted season. But then a twist in the spring, disturbing  the confirmed equasion.
PM2.5 level takes an exceeding speed in the second month of spring and decides to surprise us.
Unfortunately, due to an annoying gap in our data, with no data for the last month of spring, we are not able to track the average of data for the spring season. Comparing spring versus Winter is unfeasible. 
If you are thinking how this unexpected fluctuation appeared, we are in a same page.
There could other factors in plan, which we couldn't be sharp enough to detect, or there could be a malfactioned station or sensro leading to incorrect measurements. 
malfunctioning of the monitoring station which led to incorrect measurement

Ukraine has a high level of humidity that remains constant throughout the year. This climatic feature challenges studying the environmental factors affecting the country, such as PM2.5 pollution. Our data reveals a fascinating pattern. As the temperature drops below 15 degrees Celsius, the PM2.5 pollution levels rise. While there is a visible reduction in PM2.5 pollution when the temperature rises above 15 degrees. 
The constant high humidity disturbs our analysis and prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions about a possible interaction between humidity and PM2.5. The relation between these two factors remains a mystery. We are persistent in our research and committed to unveiling more discoveries about Vinnytsia.

Our story concludes, by adding a rolling average plot, displaying average variation. As the plot reveals a correlation between humidity and temperature regarding PM2.5, Lower temperature and higher humidity result in higher levels of PM2.5,  as suggested by scientific researches, but still spring defies the conventional expectations. Our curiosity fuels our reserach, stay with us for more exploration and adventure.
