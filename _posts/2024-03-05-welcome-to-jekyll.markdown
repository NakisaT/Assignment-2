Air pollution is one of the challenges of the 21st century that is generated by Human activities all over the world, therefore resolving this issue requires international attention as it has negative effects on human health as well as our environment and humans must cope with the consequences of pollution. carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter – usually measured as PM2.5 and PM10  are some of the prevalent air pollutants which are found in urban areas and concentration of pollution is measured by amount of pollutant per cubic meter of air. These particles are severely damaging, therefore The World Health Organization (WHO) has reduced the maximum limit for PM2.5  levels two times in recent years which must not surpass the annual limit of 5 μg/m3 (previously 10 μg/m3). 

Datasets
In order to analyze PM2.5 and achieve adequate visualization, two different data sets have been used. 
The first dataset for this project was collected from Kaggle’s website and contains information about a gas multisensor device located in a polluted area of an Italian city. This dataset includes 9357 instances of hourly averaged responses from 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an air quality multisensor device. The data spans from March 2004 to February 2005. This dataset was selected over others due to its substantial size, encompassing approximately one year’s worth of data, providing ample information for analysis.

The second dataset for this project was collected from OpenDataSoft website and contains information about air pollution levels, specifically about PM2.5, which is detected around the world. The dataset contains 9,640 rows and 10 columns, that includes: Country Code, City, Location, Coordinates, Pollutant, Source Name, Unit, Value, Last Updated, and Country Label. This dataset enables analysis of pollution trends and their impacts across different regions, general overview of PM2.5 worldwide. Utilizing this data effectively can aid researchers in formulating strategies to mitigate air pollution. By examining the trends evident in the various plots we generate, it becomes apparent that we can pinpoint the precise origins of pollution and devise appropriate solutions. 
Filtrering data
In this project, data filtering was employed to analyze the dataset, removing extraneous data and focusing on the crucial aspects relevant to our analysis. The first dataset includes air quality parameters such as: CO(GT), PT08.S1(CO), NMHC(GT), C6H6(GT), PT08.S2(NMHC), NOx(GT), PT08.S3(NOx), NO2(GT), PT08.S4(NO2), PT08.S5(O3), T, RH, and AH. Some of these parameters display negative values. These negative values indicate that the concentration of these particles is below the baseline or detection limit of the measuring device. The same applies to the second data set. However, it’s crucial to consider these values as they may not accurately represent the actual concentration in the air. Consequently, they are omitted through filtering.
